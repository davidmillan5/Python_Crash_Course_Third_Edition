# Inheritance

You don't always have to start from scratch when writing a class.
If the class you're writing is a specialized version of another class you wrote, you can
use ***inheritance***. When on class **inherits** from another, it takes on attributes
and methods of the first class. The original class is called *parent class*
and the new class is called *child class*. The child class can inherit any or all
of the attributes and methods of its parent class, but it's also free to 
define a new attribute and methods of its own.
