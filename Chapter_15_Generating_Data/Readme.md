# Chapter 15 Generating Data

**Data Visualization** is the use of visual representations
to explore and present patterns in datasets. It's closely
associated with ***data analysis***, which use code to explore
the patterns and connections in dataset. A dataset can be a
small list of numbers that fits in a single line of code,
or it can be terabytes of data that include many different 
kinds of information.
