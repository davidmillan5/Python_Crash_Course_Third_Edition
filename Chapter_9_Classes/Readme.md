# Chapter 9 Classes

***Object-oriented programming (OOP)*** is one of the most
effective approaches to writing software. In object-oriented programming,
you write classes that represent real-world things and situations, and you create objects
based on these classes. When you write a class, you define the general
behavior that a whole category of objects can have.
