# Reading From A File

An incredible amount of data is available in text files. Text files can contain
weather data, traffic data, socioeconomic data, literary works, and more.
Reading from a file is particularly useful in data analysis applications, but
it’s also applicable to any situation in which you want to analyze or modify
information stored in a file. For example, you can write a program that
reads in the contents of a text file and rewrites the file with formatting that
allows a browser to display it.
When you want to work with the information in a text file, the first step
is to read the file into memory. You can then work through all of the file’s
contents at once or work through the contents line by line.
